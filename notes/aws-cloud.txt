# Introduction to Cloud Computing

- Provides on-demand access to computing resources over the internet.
- No need for physical hardware—resources.
- Pay-as-you-go model.

## Traditional vs Cloud Infrastructure

### Traditional Infrastructure
- Requires physical servers & data centers.
- High upfront costs for hardware & maintenance.
- Manual scalability (adding more servers takes time).
- Risk of hardware failure.

### Cloud Infrastructure
- Uses virtualized cloud servers.
- Pay only for what you use (subscription based).
- Auto-scaling & instant resource provisioning.
- High availability & redundancy.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Scalability
- Cost-effectiveness
- Security
- Flexibility
- Disaster Recovery

## Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud

- **Public Cloud** – Services are shared & hosted by third party providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Private Cloud** – Exclusive cloud environment for a single organization, offering better control & security.
- **Hybrid Cloud** – Combination of public & private cloud for a balanced approach.

# AWS vs Azure vs GCP

## Amazon Web Service (AWS)
- Cloud computing platform that provides on demand access to IT resources
- No need for physical hardware
- Pay-as-you-go model

### AWS Key Features
- Scalability
- Security
- Cost-effectiveness
- High Availability
- Disaster Recovery

### Common AWS Services Overview
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- IAM (Identity & Access Management)
- Lambda
- RDS (Relational Database Service)

### Important AWS Terminologies
- **Region** – A geographical area (e.g., US-East, Asia-Pacific).
- **Availability Zone (AZ)** – Data centers inside a region
- **Edge Location** – Global caching servers for faster content delivery.
